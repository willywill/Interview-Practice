# Question 22

This question is derived from [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/).

You are given a string and an array of strings, return `true` if the string can be segmented int a space-separated sequence sequence of one or more dictionary words.

**NOTE:** The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

**Examples**:

```
Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
Output: true
```

```
Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
